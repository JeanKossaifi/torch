Contributing
============

We actively welcome new contributions! 
If you know of a tensor method that should be in TensorLy-Torch 
or if you spot any mistake, typo, missing documentation etc, 
please report it, and even better, open a Pull-Request!

How-to
------

To make sure the contribution is relevant and is not already worked on, 
you can `open an issue <https://github.com/tensorly/tensorly-torch/issues>`_!

To add code of fix issues in TensorLy, 
you will want to open a `Pull-Request <https://github.com/tensorly/tensorly-torch/pulls>`_ 
on the Github repository of the project. 

Guidelines
----------

For each function or class, we expect helpful docstrings in the NumPy format, 
as well as unit-tests to make sure it is working as expected
 (especially helpful for future refactoring to make sure no exising code is broken!)

Check the existing code for examples, 
and don't hesitate to contact us if you are unsure or have any question!
